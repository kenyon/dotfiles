# Purpose of this file, .zlogin: commands that should be executed only
# in login shells. Not the place for alias definitions, options,
# environment variable settings, etc.; as a general rule, it should
# not change the shell environment at all. Rather, it should be used
# to set the terminal type and run a series of external commands
# (fortune, msgs, etc).
